# How Helping Eyes is hosted

Your Mac is the server. The app reads text with Apple Vision, which exists only on macOS, so it cannot run on
Linux hosts. Nothing is uploaded anywhere: you run the app on your Mac and, if other people should use it,
give it a public `https` address with a free tunnel. No account, no card.

## One-time setup

1. Get a free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and put it in `helping_eyes/.env` as `LLM_API_KEY=your_key` (copy `helping_eyes/.env.example` to `.env` first).
2. Install the packages: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (run from the top folder).
3. Install the tunnel tool: `brew install cloudflared`.

## Each time you want it online

1. Plug in the charger and keep the lid open.
2. Run `.venv/bin/python run.py --share`. On a Mac, `run.py` also stops the laptop from sleeping when idle.
3. Wait for "Ready: the text reader has loaded". A `https://...trycloudflare.com` address is printed.
4. Open that address on a phone or send it to anyone. Allow the camera and microphone (they need `https`). Use Chrome or Edge: speech recognition needs one of them.
5. Press Ctrl+C when you are done. The address stops working.

To use the app only on your Mac, run `python run.py` without `--share`. It opens Chrome at `localhost`.

## Check that it works

Open `<address>/api/health`. You should see `"status":"ok"`, `"llm_configured":true` and `"ocr":"ready"`. It also shows `"memory_mb"` (what the app uses now) and `"tts"` (whether the Edge voice is on).

## The settings

Put these in `helping_eyes/.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Setting | Needed? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Your free key from Google AI Studio. Keep it secret. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | Which AI model to use (default `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`). If the app says the model name was not found, look up the current Flash-Lite name and set it here. |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | No | Which AI service to talk to. Change it (with the model and key) to use another provider, such as Groq or OpenRouter. |
| `TTS_VOICE`, `TTS_RATE`, `TTS_ENABLED` | No | The spoken voice (a free Microsoft Edge voice) and its speed; `TTS_ENABLED=0` uses the browser's own voice. |
| `QWEN_3B_MODEL`, `QWEN_BASE_URL` | No | The local Qwen 3B model in the page's Model menu (default `qwen2.5:3b-instruct` through Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1`). `run.py` starts Ollama for you if it is installed; `--no-ollama` skips that. It runs on your Mac, so visitors using the shared address can pick it too, but it is slower when several people ask at once. |
| `PORT` | No | The port to use (default 7860); `run.py --port` does the same. |

## Things to know

- **The address works only while the Mac is awake and `run.py --share` is running.** It is new every run, so send the new address each time.
- **Run only one copy.** Each visitor's captured text and conversation are kept in the server's memory, so two copies would not share them. A restart clears them.
- **Anyone with the address uses your Gemini key's quota**, so share it with people you trust. The app limits how many requests one visitor can make per minute.
- **The free Gemini limits.** The free AI plan has a daily limit. When it is used up, the app says the model is busy. Expiry questions, page-number questions and "read everything" never use the AI, so they keep working.
- **Privacy.** The text of what you capture (never the picture) is sent to the AI service, and the sentences to be spoken are sent to Microsoft's voice service. Check their terms before using private documents.
- **Memory.** The text reader needs roughly 0.4 to 1 GB while it reads; a Mac has plenty.

## The files that matter

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `run.py` | The start button: checks the setup, starts the server, opens Chrome, and with `--share` opens the tunnel. |
| `helping_eyes/server.py` | The front desk: receives pictures and requests from visitors and sends answers back. |
| `helping_eyes/vision.py` | The eyes: reads text from pictures with Apple Vision, fixes bad photos, understands book pages, and gives the "move closer" hints. |
| `helping_eyes/commands.py` | The listener and the voice: decides if what you said is a command or a question, and turns each sentence into spoken audio. |
| `helping_eyes/assistant.py` | The answerer: asks the AI model (Gemini, or Qwen 3B on your Mac) and searches the web when you agree. |
| `helping_eyes/web/` | The web page: `index.html` (layout), `app.js` (camera, voice and speaking), `style.css` (looks). |
| `helping_eyes/.env.example` | A template of the settings. Copy it to `.env` and put your key in it. `.gitignore` keeps `.env` out of git. |
| `.github/workflows/check.yml` | Makes GitHub run all the tests on a Mac every time you push. It does not deploy anything. |
